## Problem Statement
- How can we optimise/improve grab services from this datasets?

## Models Used
- **Linear Regression**: Applied to predict 'weighted_rating' from features such as 'delivery_time' and 'total opening time hours', with evaluation using MSE and RÂ².

- **Ridge and Lasso Regression**: Utilized to address potential overfitting and multicollinearity, with models tested across various alpha values to assess impact on performance.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Included scatter plots and boxplots to visualize and understand the data relationships and distribution.

- **Outlier Handling**: Identification and removal of outliers to improve model accuracy, particularly for features like 'delivery_time'.

- **One-Hot Encoding**: Transformed categorical variables like 'loc_type' and 'delivery_options' for regression analysis.

- **ANOVA Tests**: Conducted to examine the differences in 'weighted_rating' across categories such as 'delivery_options'.

- **Correlation Analysis**: Performed to determine the strength and direction of relationships between variables.

These methods collectively contributed to a comprehensive data-driven approach to analyze and optimize Grab's services.

## What did we learn from this project?
- ANOVA technique
- Ridge and Lasso
- Data representation like heatmap on map
- Other packages: json, statsmodels.api, OneHotEncoder
- Collaborating using GitHub
